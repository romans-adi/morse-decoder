<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# <a name="about-project"> Morse Decoder </a>

The Morse Decoder is a Ruby program that translates Morse code messages into readable text. It takes Morse code as input and utilizes a binary tree representation to decode each character correctly. The program follows the structure of the binary tree, traversing left or right based on the dots and dashes in the Morse code. Once the decoding process is completed, the decoded text is printed as the output. The implementation uses a modular approach, with the decoder logic encapsulated in a Decoder class, making it reusable and easy to maintain.

<!-- Features -->

## Features <a name="features"></a>

### Key Features <a name="key-features"></a>

 - [x] Morse Code Translation: The Morse Decoder efficiently translates Morse code messages into readable text, using a binary tree representation to decode each character accurately.
 - [x] Modularity: The decoder logic is encapsulated within a Decoder class, promoting code organization and reusability.
 - [x] User-Friendly Input: Users can input Morse code messages in a human-readable format (e.g., '.- -... ---'), making it convenient to use.
 - [x] Binary Tree Representation: The implementation employs a binary tree to represent the structure of the Morse code characters, facilitating efficient decoding.

### Future Features <a name="future-features"></a>

- [ ] Encode Text to Morse: Add the capability to encode text into Morse code, allowing users to convert plain text messages into Morse code.
- [ ] Morse Code History: Include a feature to store previously decoded messages, allowing users to review their decoded history.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

### Setup <a name="setup"></a>

1. Ensure you have Ruby installed on your system. You can check your Ruby version in the terminal by running:

```ruby -v```

If Ruby is not installed, you can download and install it from the official Ruby website.

2. To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.
Choose the directory on your local machine where you want to copy project. For example:

> cd /home/user/name-of-your-directory

Clone the project using one of the options.

Using SSH-key:

> git clone git@github.com:romans-adi/morse-decoder.git

Using HTTPS:

> git clone https://github.com/romans-adi/morse-decoder.git

You can also create the new directory just adding the name of it in the end of command. For example:

> git clone https://github.com/romans-adi/morse-decoder.git morse-decoder

### Installation <a name="installation"></a>

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory where you have cloned or downloaded the Morse Decoder repository.

3. Run the following command to install any required dependencies (in this case, we assume there are no external dependencies, so this step may not be needed):
```bundle install```

### Usage <a name="usage"></a>

1. Once the setup is complete, ensure you are still in the directory containing the Morse Decoder files.

2. To run the app, execute the following command:

```ruby main.rb```

3. The decoded message will be displayed as the output.

4. If you have future features like GUI or interactive mode, follow the specific instructions provided for those features in the app's documentation.
